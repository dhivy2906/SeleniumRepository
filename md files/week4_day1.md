### Abstraction:

1. **Definition**: 
   - Abstraction is an OOPs concept that focuses on hiding complex implementation details and exposing only the necessary parts of an object. It's about representing features without including background details.

2. **Advantages of Abstraction**:
   - **Simplicity**: Abstraction simplifies the view of an object, so you don't need to understand the internal workings to use it.
   - **Reusability**: Abstract classes and interfaces can be reused to implement common methods in multiple subclasses.

3. **Keyword**: The `implements` keyword is used to implement an Interface

4. **Types**:
   - **Interfaces**: Used for full abstraction, they cannot have any implementation.
   - **Abstract Classes**: Provide partial abstraction with some implemented methods.
   - **Concrete Classes**: Regular classes with full implementation.

5. **Java Examples**: 
   - **Interfaces**: `List`, `Set`, `Map` are interfaces providing a standard set of methods to be implemented by concrete collections.
   - **Abstract Classes**: `AbstractList`, `AbstractCollection` provide skeletal implementations that can be used as starting points for creating concrete collections.

6. **Selenium WebDriver Examples**:
   - **Interfaces**: `WebDriver`, `WebElement`, `Alert` are interfaces representing abstract concepts in browser automation.
   - **Abstract Classes**: `By` is an abstract class providing methods to locate elements.
   - **Concrete Classes**: `RemoteWebDriver` is a concrete implementation of the `WebDriver` interface.




### Polymorphism:

- **Definition**
     - Polymorphism in Java is a concept by which we can perform a single action in different ways. 
     - It is derived from two Greek words: "poly" and "morphs". "Poly" means many and "morphs" means forms.

- **Types**
       - compile-time polymorphism 
       - runtime polymorphism. 
       _Compile-time polymorphism_ is achieved by _method overloading_, while _runtime polymorphism_ is achieved by _method overriding_. 
       - It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common super class for seamless interaction, typically through the use of method overriding within an inheritance hierarchy. 
       - This enables Java programs to be written more abstractly, promoting scalability and maintainability.

- **Overloading**: 
      - It refers to the ability to create multiple methods of the same name with different implementations.  -Calls to an overloaded method will run a specific implementation of that method appropriate to the context, based on the number and type of arguments passed.

- **Java Examples**: 
     - Methods like `add()` can be overloaded to accept different types of arguments. 
     - Similarly, `substring()` in the `String` class is overloaded to accept different starting and ending points for the substring.
     - println()

- **Selenium WebDriver Examples**: 
    - The `frame()` method in Selenium WebDriver is overloaded to allow different types of arguments like an integer (index of the frame), a String (name or ID of the frame), or a WebElement.



- **Advantages of Overloading**:
  - **Flexibility**: Allows methods to handle different data types and numbers of arguments.
  - **Readability**: It can make the code more readable  since the same method name can be used for similar actions on different types of input.
  - **Reduces Complexity**: Developers can use the same method name to perform similar actions, which simplifies code organization and maintenance.

**Overriding**
  - Method overriding in Java occurs when a subclass has a method with the same name, return type, and parameters as a method in its superclass. 
  - It's a key feature of runtime polymorphism and allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation for a method that is already provided by its parent class

Examples:
  - equals() of String class is overriden from the Object class
  - toString() of String class is overriden from the Object class
  - quit() of ChromiumDriver is overriden from the RemoteWebDriver Class  



### List Interface in Java

- **Definition**: The `List` interface in Java is part of the Java Collections Framework. It represents an ordered collection (also known as a sequence). Lists can contain duplicate elements and are dynamic in size, meaning they can grow or shrink as needed.
- **Why Use Lists**: Lists are used when you need an ordered collection that can change in size. This is particularly useful when you don't know the number of elements in advance, or when you need to perform frequent insertions and deletions.
- **ArrayList vs LinkedList**: While `ArrayList` is the most common implementation, providing fast access and efficient storage for large numbers of elements, `LinkedList` can be more efficient for certain use cases, especially where frequent insertion and deletion occur.

### Methods and Use Cases
1. **Creating Lists (`new ArrayList<>()`):**
   - **Usage:** To initialize a list.
   - **Real-time Use Case:** In a real-world scenario, you might initialize a list to store data such as employee names, product details, or any collection of similar items. For example, a list to store the names of participants in a workshop.

2. **Adding Items (`add()` method):**
   - **Usage:** To add elements to the list.
   - **Real-time Use Case:** This is used when you need to add new data to your collection. For example, adding new members to a project team or new items to a to-do list.

3. **Inserting at Specific Index (`add(index, element)`):**
   - **Usage:** To add an element at a specified position in the list.
   - **Real-time Use Case:** Useful in cases where the order is important, like adding a new task at a specific position in a task list or inserting a new chapter into a specific position in a book's table of contents.

4. **Printing the List (`System.out.println(list)`):**
   - **Usage:** To display the contents of the list.
   - **Real-time Use Case:** Displaying a list of items, such as a list of available products to a user, or printing a list of registered participants for an event.

5. **Adding All Elements from Another List (`addAll()`):**
   - **Usage:** To add all elements from one list into another.
   - **Real-time Use Case:** Merging two datasets, such as combining two lists of customers from different regions into a single list for a unified analysis.

6. **Finding the Size of the List (`size()` method):**
   - **Usage:** To get the number of elements in the list.
   - **Real-time Use Case:** Checking the number of entries in a database, like the number of students enrolled in a course or the number of items in stock.

7. **Accessing Elements (`get(index)`):**
   - **Usage:** To retrieve a specific element from the list based on its index.
   - **Real-time Use Case:** Fetching a specific data entry, such as retrieving a specific order detail from a list of orders.

8. **Removing Elements (`remove(index)` and `removeAll()`):**
   - **Usage:** `remove(index)` removes an element at a specific index, while `removeAll()` removes all elements that are present in another collection.
   - **Real-time Use Case:** `remove(index)` can be used for deleting a specific entry, like removing a discontinued product from a product list. `removeAll()` can be useful in filtering out data, like removing all outdated items from a current inventory list.

9. **Clearing the List (`clear()`):**
   - **Usage:** To remove all elements from the list, making it empty.
   - **Real-time Use Case:** Resetting data, such as clearing a user's shopping cart after they have completed the checkout process.
