**Control and Jump Statements:**

*Definition:* 
   Control statements in Java are used to manage the flow of execution in a program. They include decision-making statements

*Looping Statements:*
    For Loop: Repeats a block of code a specific number of times.

### Arrays:
1. **Definition:**
   An array in Java is a data structure that stores a fixed-size, ordered collection of elements of the same data type. Arrays provide a convenient way to group related data items under a single name. The elements in an array are accessed using an index, starting from 0. Arrays are useful for efficiently managing and manipulating large sets of data.

2. **Explanation:**
  *Declaration:*
    Arrays are declared with a type, followed by square brackets ([]).
    Example: int[] numbers;
  *Initialization:*
    Arrays can be initialized when declared or later using the new keyword.
    Example: int[] numbers = new int[5];
  *Accessing Elements:*
   Elements in an array are accessed using their index (starting from 0).
   Example: int firstNumber = numbers[0];
  *Length of Array:*
   The length of an array is obtained using the length attribute.
   Example: int arrayLength = numbers.length;



**Steps to execute in Debug mode:**

    1. Set a break Point(double tap/click on the blue line will add/remove break point )
            -shortcut key --> ctrl+shift+b
    2. Right click --> Debug as --> Java Application
    3. Click on the Swtich button for Debug perspective
    4. Click on Resume icon or use f8 key
            - it will go to the next break point
